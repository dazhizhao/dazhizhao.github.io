Hi! I'm a third-year undergraduate student from [School of Aerospace Engineering and Applied Mechanics](https://aero-mech.tongji.edu.cn/), [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/). My main research interests are focused on the following directions: 
1. Data-driven mechanical design.
2. Differentiable simulation and programming.
3. Neural network architecture optimization for computer vision.

It's very fortunate for me to be advised by [Prof. Tang](https://aero-mech.tongji.edu.cn/e7/61/c23511a255841/page.htm) of FCM Lab from School of Aerospace Engineering and Applied Mechanics, Tongji University. Meanwhile, I am also advised by [Prof. Fan](https://www.ruirangerfan.com/) of [MIAS Group](https://mias.group/) from [School of Electronic and Information Engineering](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/), Tongji University.

Currently, I'm seeking opportunities to apply for Ph.D. program in 27Fall!
